# Pixelmeister

`Pixelmeister` is a platform-independent tool designed to simplify the development of graphical user interfaces for microelectronic devices. It currently emulates the `Pixels` and `UTFT` graphics libraries (including `uText`).
`Pixelmeister` helps simulate user interfaces without the need to download and test the code on the target device after each UI customization step. This tool can also convert `TTF`/`OTF` images, icons, and fonts into a very compact format suitable for use in microcontroller programs.
